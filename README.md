# Overview

{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
The game is a simple mario liek platformer with coins that add 100 points and enimeies that if there head is jumped on add 50 points.
The game consists of 2 levels a start and end screens and was built in order to help teach me the fundementals of the godot engine. the game plays like a standard platformer using 
wasd to move around and space to jump

I have recently been hired to develope these game in godot since I have little experienc in the software or the GDscript languge I started this little game
project to help out.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
